<h3>Raytracers game</h3> 
<p>There are several things I want to implement in this project, the first one would be several puzzle games, where each game is required to be completed in order to open a chest. the details on these puzzle games would be that there should be two to four minigames in total. one game will be sudoku, another mini game will be a waterpipe minigame that you need to find the right configuration of pipes so the water comes through. The third would be a ping pong like minigame where you will need to destroy all the blocks in order to finish the game.<p/>

<br> <h3>Raytracing</h3>
<p> the light emitted by the lantern on the playerâ€™s hands. where I will need to use several techniques to figure out where to actually draw the map elements,
or make them brighter.<p/>

<br><h3>Enemies</h3>
<p>enemies that are going to be chasing you at all times and you will have to run so It does not capture you.</p>

<br><h3>TopDown view</h3>
<p>The game will be top down view and will use tilemaps to create the map where the character will be in.<p/> 

<br><h3>"Chests" Character</h3>
<p>The player will be able to collect keys on the chests the player succesfully open. The player can spend the keys in either way, super powe ups or a level skip, it also there will be a shop where the player can spend the keys on cosmetic items or super power ups. <p/>
