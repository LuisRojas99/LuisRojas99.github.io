<h2>Test Report</h2>

<p>1. Component Testing</p>
<p>Component testing was done by fractioning to small sets of key code scripts. The key code scripts were, creating fonts, implementing the fonts, creating buttons, creating movement scripts, clicking scripts, making visuals, creating the scripts for the sudoku buttons and gird. each one of these scripts were done with smaller task individualy, testing through the proces of each one of them, until they were fully developed, then they were added to the system.</p>
<p>2. System Testing</p>
<p>For the system testing, I heavely worked on the most important scripts, and then when these scripts were done then passed to do the little things (not so important). This made my work a lot easier rather than work on non important stuff then realize that the bigger stuff was broken. the issues were a lot on the begining but as the whole system made progress there were found less and less errors to correct(debug). (Think about incremental programing, or recursion allways do the base cases(important pieces) first)</p>
<p>3. Acceptance Testing</p>
<p>All of the testing was made by me, the acceptance testing was also made by me, I would sit down and pretend I did want to play the game and focus on the implementations from the user stories, if it was good enough then it is accepted accounting that only one person is doing the work.</p>
<p>Story 1, The user easily identifies itself on the screen, knows who they are without stating it. This was acomplished. </p>
<p>Story 2, The user should be confortable with what they are seeing. This was acomplished, although this  is true, the background for the main menu should change since the color scheme is not the same for the actual game</p>
<p>Story 3, The user needs menus before even starting the game. This was acomplished, although this was accopmlished menus need visual settings.</p>  
<p>Story 4, The player needs the different game stages to be separated from one another. This was accomplished.</p> 
<p>Story 5, The player needed some kind of puzzle game that is chalenging. This was accomplihsed, although it was accomplished, the sudoku game needs to be finished in full operation</p>
<p>Story 6, The player a game with music. This was accopmplished, needs slide bar for adjusting the volume.</p>
<p>Story 7, There are win states for the minigames. This was not accopmplished, I could not figure out how to mkae the winning states true.</p>
